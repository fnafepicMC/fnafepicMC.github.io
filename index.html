   <h1> Advanced Explosives </h1>
   <p> the Advanced Explosives mod is a mod i made that adds 4 explosives and a new ore to the game, along with a new type of smelting block called a centrifuge.</p>
    <h2> Uranium Ore </h2>
    <p> Uranium is an ore that spawns in 2 types, (weak and strong), that spawns above redstone and diamonds, but under coal. you smelt it in a centrifuge to turn it into a stabilized form. </p>
    <p>This ore is also used to make each type of upgraded tnt except for Grenades</p>
    <h2> Uranium Chunks</h2>
    <p> Uranium Chunks are the smelted form of uranium, in can be crafted into Uranium blocks, or used for more explosive tnt. </p>
    <p> actually, only Strong Uranium Chunks can be crafted into explosive tnt because Weak Uranium Chunks have to be crafted into blocks to craft any explosive tnt types. </p>
    <h2> Centrifuge </h2>
    <p> The Centrifuge is used to smelt uranium. if you put Raw Uranium in the unsmelted spots, the type of Uranium will turn in to the Chunk, or the smelted variant. </p>
    <h2> Explosive tnt </h2>
    <p> Explosive tnt is a more explosive type of tnt crafted with 4 tnt on corners, one Weak Uranium Block on the bottom, 3 Strong Uranium Chunks on the sides, and  1 Slime Block in the middle. </p>
    <p> Unlike the normal tnt, explosive tnt takes longer to explode, and it does not drop when it is ignited. </p>
    <h2> Grenades </h2>
    <p> Grenades can be thrown like snowballs, and they make a small explosion when they land. </p>
    <p> Grenades have a smaller explosion than tnt, so they do less damage to blocks, but you can throw them at a faster speed. </p>
    <p> Grenades are crafted with Iron Ingots on Corners, a Stone Button on top, tnt in the middle, and the leftover 3 are White Concrete </p>
    <h2> Big Bomb </h2>
    <p> The Big Bomb takes 20 seconds to explode, and will be a lot more explosive than tnt, Explosive tnt, or Grenades, but they are not as powerful as Atomic Bombs. </p>
    <p> To craft a Big Bomb, you need 3 Explosive tnt on top, a Slime Block on center, two Iron Blocks next to the Slime Block, Two Redstone Blocks under the Iron Blocks, and one Strong Uranium Chunk Bottom-Middle </p>
    <h2> Atomic Bombs. </h2>
    <p> Atomic bombs are the Ultimate explosive you can make, in this part of the mod. they are super powerful, exploding about 25x as much as explosive tnt. they also take 30 seconds to explode. </p>
    <p> The Crafting Recipe for the Atomic Bomb is 4 Iron BLocks on corners, 1 Strong Uranium on the top, 1 Weak Uranium Block in the middle, Explosive tnt on the bottom, and the sides are Big Bombs. </p>
    <p> There is a secret crafting recipe for the Triple Nuclear Bomb. it explodes so big it crashed my game.</p>
